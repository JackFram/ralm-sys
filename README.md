# RaLMSpec - A Speculation and Caching Framework for Retrieval-augmented Language Models

Retrieval-augmented language models (RaLM) have emerged as a powerful approach for addressing knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP) tasks. RaLM combines a non-parametric knowledge base with a parametric language model to deliver impressive results. 

To overcome the overhead challenges associated with iterative RaLM, we introduce RaLMSpec, a novel framework inspired by speculation and caching techniques. RaLMSpec offers a generic speed-up solution for iterative RaLM while maintaining consistent model outputs. This is achieved through two key mechanisms: **speculative retrieval** and **batched verification**.

By incorporating additional features such as prefetching, an optimal speculation stride scheduler, and asynchronous verification, RaLMSpec maximizes its potential for accelerating RaLM workflows.

## Evaluation and Conclusion

Extensive evaluations were conducted using three different language models on four downstream question-answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate the remarkable speed-up capabilities of RaLMSpec:

- When using an exact dense retriever, RaLMSpec achieves a speed-up ratio of $1.75$-$2.39\times$ compared to the baseline.
- When utilizing an approximate dense retriever, RaLMSpec delivers a speed-up ratio of $1.04$-$1.39\times$ compared to the baseline.
- With a sparse retriever, RaLMSpec achieves a speed-up ratio of $1.31$-$1.77\times$ compared to the baseline.

In summary, RaLMSpec offers an effective solution to enhance the efficiency of iterative RaLM approaches, making them even more powerful and practical for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.
